# First-CS-Project

The aim of this simple project is to understand in depth the C# fundamentals.

### Tools
* C#
* Visual Studio
* LINQ

### Project Explanation

Basicaly this is a mini chart app.This app shows the products that are available &nbsp; <br>
and the user chooses the type and after that the name of product they want to buy. &nbsp; <br>
After bought all the things, they have to decide if they want to remove any of the products they have bought. &nbsp; <br>

### Technical Part

The Progarm.cs file was used to create a file with the available products. &nbsp; <br>
Product class in an abstract class. &nbsp; <br>
DeviceProduct and CD_Product inherit the Product class. &nbsp; <br>
Movie and Game classes inherit the CD_Product. &nbsp; <br>
Mobile_Phone and Caming_Console inherit the DeviceProduct. &nbsp; <br>
Buyer.cs file is used as the main app for making purchase.

### Notes
Program.cs was top-level file, but not anymore. &nbsp; <br>
Program.cs acted like a script code because of the above. &nbsp; <br>
The Buyer.cs file has the main method. &nbsp; <br>
The aim was to understand what happened with top-level-files on C#. &nbsp; <br>
